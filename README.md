## Description
This assignment's goal was to create a program that generates a profession README file based on certain user inputs. The following criteria have been met

```
- The user's project title is displayed as the title of the README
- Information regarding the description, installation, usage, license, contributions, testing instructions and questions is prompted to the user and their inputs are added to the README file when it is generated.
- When choosing a license, a badge is displayed at the top of the file with the name of the license.
- The user's GitHub username and their email address is added to those sections of the README
- Any links clicked on in the table of contents will send the user to that section of the README.

```

## Installation Instructions
There are only two things that need to be installed:
1. node-fetch (npm install node-fetch@2)
2. inquirer (npm install inquirer)

## Usage
The use of this assignment is to have a README file template populated with a user's inputs so they don't have to manually create a README file for every project they create.
